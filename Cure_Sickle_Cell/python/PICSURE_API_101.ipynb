    "\n",
    "PIC-SURE stands for Patient-centered Information Commons: Standardized Unification of Research Elements. Original data exposed through PIC-SURE API encompasses a large heterogeneity of data organization underneath. PIC-SURE hides this complexity and exposes the different study datasets in a single tabular format. By simplifying the process of data extraction, it allows investigators to focus on the downstream analyses and to facilitate reproducible sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More about PIC-SURE\n",
    "The API is available in two different programming languages, python and R, allowing investigators to query datasets in the same way using either of language. The R/python PIC-SURE API is a small part of the entire PIC-SURE platform.\n",
    "\n",

This will allow the notebook to take into account changes in imported external files, such as the user defined functions stored in separate file, without needing to manually reload libraries. This is helpful when developing interactively. Learn more about [IPython Magic commands](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html)."
