    "\n",
    "As part of the BioData Catalyst initiative, the Patient Information Commons Standard Unification of Research Elements (PIC-SURE) platform has been integrating clinical and genomic datasets funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Original data exposed through the PIC-SURE API encompasses a large heterogeneity of data organization underneath. PIC-SURE hides this complexity and exposes the different study datasets in a single tabular format. By simplifying the process of data extraction, it allows investigators to focus on the downstream analyses and to facilitate reproducible sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### More about PIC-SURE\n",
    "The API is available in two different programming languages, python and R, enabling investigators to query the databases the same way using either language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PIC-SURE is a larger project from which the R/python PIC-SURE API is only a brick. Among other things, PIC-SURE also offers a graphical user interface that allows researchers to explore variables across multiple studies, filter patients that match criteria, and create cohorts from this interactive exploration.\n",
