    "# Export data from User Interface (UI) to analysis workspace\n",
    "This is a tutorial notebook that walks through the process of exporting selected data from the *NHLBI BioData CatalystÂ® (BDC) Powered by PIC-SURE* User Interface, or UI, into an analysis workspace. This is done using the *BDC Powered by PIC-SURE (BDC-PIC-SURE)* Application Programming Interface, or API.\n",

    "## Introduction to exporting data into an analysis workspace with PIC-SURE\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things are needed to export data into an analysis workspace:\n",
    "1. Personalized access token: a user-specific token that tells PIC-SURE which studies a user is authorized to access\n",
    "2. Query ID: a token that describes the specific query that was built in the UI, for example, if a user has selected females with body mass index between 18 and 30 from the ARIC study\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these two components, the API can be used to export the selected data into the analysis workspace (in this case, where this Jupyter Notebook is being run). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Getting your user-specific security token\n",
    "**Before running this notebook, please be sure to review the \"Get your security token\" documentation, which exists in the `README.md` file. It explains about how to get a security token, which is mandatory to access the databases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Setting up your notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites for the notebook\n",
    "* python 3.6 or later\n",
    "* pip python package manager, already available in most systems with a python interpreter installed (link to pip)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install packages to connect to the PIC-SURE API\n",
    "The first step to using the PIC-SURE API is to install the packages needed. The following code installs the PIC-SURE API components from GitHub, specifically:\n",
    "* PIC-SURE Client\n",
    "* PIC-SURE Adapter\n",
    "* BioData Catalyst PIC-SURE Adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that if you are using the dedicated PIC-SURE environment within the *BDC Powered by Seven Bridges (BDC-Seven Bridges)* platform, the necessary packages have already been installed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Troubleshooting: if you encounter an error while installing packages or connecting to a PIC-SURE resource, try restarting your kernel and trying again.*"
