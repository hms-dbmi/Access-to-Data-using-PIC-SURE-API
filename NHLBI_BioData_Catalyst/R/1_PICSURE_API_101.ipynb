    "\n",
    "Original data exposed through PIC-SURE API encompasses a large heterogeneity of data organization underneath. PIC-SURE hides this complexity and exposes the different study datasets in a single tabular format. By simplifying the process of data extraction, it allows investigators to focus on the downstream analyses and to facilitate reproducible science.\n",

    "PIC-SURE is a larger project from which the R/python PIC-SURE API is only a brick. Among other things, PIC-SURE also offers a graphical user interface that allows researchers to explore variables across multiple studies, filter patients that match criteria, and create cohorts from this interactive exploration.\n",
