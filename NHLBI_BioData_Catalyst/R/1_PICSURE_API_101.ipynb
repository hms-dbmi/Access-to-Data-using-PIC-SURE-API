    "\n",
    "As part of the *NHLBI BioData CatalystÂ® (BDC)* ecosystem, the Patient Information Commons Standard Unification of Research Elements (PIC-SURE) platform has been integrating clinical and genomic datasets from multiple TOPMed and TOPMed related studies funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Original data exposed through PIC-SURE API encompasses a large heterogeneity of data organization underneath. PIC-SURE hides this complexity and exposes the different study datasets in a single tabular format. By simplifying the process of data extraction, it allows investigators to focus on the downstream analyses and to facilitate reproducible science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### More about PIC-SURE\n",
    "The API is available in two different programming languages, python and R, enabling investigators to query the databases the same way using either language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PIC-SURE is a larger project from which the R/python PIC-SURE API is only a brick. Among other things, PIC-SURE also offers a graphical user interface that allows researchers to explore variables across multiple studies, filter patients that match criteria, and create cohorts from this interactive exploration.\n",
