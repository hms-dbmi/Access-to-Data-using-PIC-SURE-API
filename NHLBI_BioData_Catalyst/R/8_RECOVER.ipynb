    "RECOVER is a first-of-its-kind, patient-centered research initiative to understand, diagnose, treat, and prevent Long COVID. RECOVER research includes observational cohort studies, electronic health records analysis, pathobiology studies, tissue pathology studies, and clinical trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "RECOVER studies involve thousands of people from all walks of life, hundreds of research investigators, and millions of electronic health records (EHRs). RECOVER aims to achieve the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the range of recovery from Long COVID and the changes it can cause in people over time.\n",
    "* Define risk factors, understand the number of people getting Long COVID, and determine whether there are specific, different Long COVID types.\n",
    "* Study how Long COVID changes over time and how those changes may relate to other illnesses.\n",
    "* Identify possible treatments for Long COVID symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers can utilize BioData Catalyst Powered by PIC-SURE to search terms, apply filters, build cohorts, and export of the RECOVER Adult data in an analysis-ready format. "

    "Postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as *long COVID* is defined as ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms or conditions present 30 or more days after infection. A recent publication developed a preliminary rule for defining PASC based on a score derived from the most frequently reported symptoms from those with long COVID. A PASC score between 0 and 34 is assigned based on a person's symptoms, where a greater score indicates more PASC symptoms. The publication also defined a cutoff based on this score to identify individuals as PASC positive or PASC negative:\n",
