    "2. **dbGaP ingested, but not format compliant**\n",
    "3. **Not ingested by dbGaP** - are not format-compliant and do not have a study accession number (or phs number)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIC-SURE Data Dictionary Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "* **values**: An array of all unique values included for the variable.\n",
    "* **studyId**: ID associated with a study. For dbGaP-assosciated studies this is in the format phsxxxxxx. Non-dbGaP studies can be in other formats. The field is consistent with the DBGAP ACCESSION NUMBER in BDC Powered by Gen3.\n",
    "* **dtId**: ID associated with the table the variable is stored in within the study. For studies in dbGaP format, this is provided as “phtXXXXXXX”. Non-compliant studies can instead be names of the table or form, listed as \"All Variables\" if the variables were not grouped in a table or form.\n",

    "* **columnmeta_is_stigmatized**: boolean True/False value that determines whether a variable is shown in Open PIC-SURE. A value of True means that the variable is not shown in Open PIC-SURE. For further information about stigmatizing variables, please refer to this documentation: https://github.com/hms-dbmi/biodata_catalyst_stigmatizing_variables/tree/main\n",
    "* **columnmeta_name**: A short text ID associated with a variable. These are often not human-readable as they are mostly derived from the column names in datasets. For non-compliant studies, this can be a duplicate of the varID field.\n",
    "* **description**: A text field with a human-readable description of the variable. When not provided by the study submitters, this field will be a duplicate of the columnmeta_name field.\n",

    "* **derived_variable_level_data**: An array of additional information that is study- and variable-specific. An example would be units of measurement. This is only available for some of the studies.\n",
    "* **data_hierarchy**: A text field displaying a human-readable path that is used in the PIC-SURE user interface. This is only available for some of the studies.\n",

    "* **derived_study_abv_name**: Short text abbreviation used to refer to a study and shown in the PIC-SURE user interface.\n",
    "* **derived_study_description**: Description of the study, consistent with the “Full Name” field i BDC Powered by Gen3.\n",
    "* **columnmeta_min**: Field generated internally for use in the PIC-SURE user interface elements for specific studies. Describes the minimum associated with continuous variables. \n",
    "* **columneta_max**: Fields generated internally for use in the PIC-SURE user interface elements for specific studies. Describes the maximum associated with continuous variables.\n",
