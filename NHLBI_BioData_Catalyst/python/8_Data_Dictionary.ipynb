    "\n",
    "**dtId** - ID associated with the table the variable is stored in within the study. For studies in dbGap format this is provided as phtxxxxxxx. Non-compliant studies can instead be names of the table/form, listed as \"All Variables\" if the variables were not grouped in a table/form.\n",

    "**columnmeta_is_stigmatized** - boolean True/False value that determines if a varaible is shown in PIC-SURE Open Access. A value of True means that variable is not shown in Open Access. Further description availible here: (https://github.com/hms-dbmi/biodata_catalyst_stigmatizing_variables/tree/main)\n",
