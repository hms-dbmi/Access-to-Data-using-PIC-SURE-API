    "As part of the *NHLBI BioData Catalyst® (BDC)* ecosystem, the Patient Information Commons: Standard Unification of Research Elements (PIC-SURE) platform has been integrating clinical and genomic datasets from multiple TOPMed and TOPMed-related studies funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). \n",
    "\n",
    "Original data exposed through the PIC-SURE API encompasses a large heterogeneity of data organization underneath. PIC-SURE hides this complexity and esposes the different study datasets in a single tabular format. By simplifying the process of data extraction, it allows investigators to focus on downstream analysis and to facilitate reproducible science. "
