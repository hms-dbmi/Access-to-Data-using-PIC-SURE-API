    "# PIC-SURE API tutorial using UDN database\n",
    "This is a tutorial notebook, aimed to be quickly up and running with the R PIC-SURE API. It covers the main functionalities of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## R PIC-SURE API\n",
    "### What is PIC-SURE?\n",
    "Databases exposed through PIC-SURE API encompass a wide heterogeneity of architectures and data organizations underneath. PIC-SURE hides this complexity and expose the different databases in the same format, allowing researchers to focus on the analysis and medical insights, thus easing the process of reproducible sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More about PIC-SURE\n",
    "PIC-SURE stands for Patient-centered Information Commons: Standardized Unification of Research Elements. The API is available in two different programming languages, Python and R, allowing investigators to query databases in the same way using any of those languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "PIC-SURE is a large project from which the R/Python PIC-SURE API is only a brick. Among other things, PIC-SURE also offers a graphical user interface, allowing research scientist to get quick knowledge about variables and data available for a specific data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API is actively developed by the Avillach-Lab at Harvard Medical School.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub repo:\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-python-adapter-hpds\n",
    "* https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-python-client\n",

    "\n",
    "## Getting your own user-specific security token\n",
    "**Before running this notebook, please be sure to review the get_your_token.ipynb notebook. It contains explanation about how to get a security token, mandatory to access the databases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisites: \n",
    "* R >= 3.6\n",
